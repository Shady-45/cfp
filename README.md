# Getting Started with IndieCrypt

This project was bootstrapped with [React ](https://Indiecrypt.site).

## Description

#Through the decentralised contribution platform Indiecrypt, users may pay cryptocurrency (eth) to their preferred content creators, who can then publish their works such as music, graphics, scripts, and more. There will be a Sign Up page and a Sign In page for users to login, and Meta Mask wallet will be integrated for transactions so that users can purchase and download assets.
